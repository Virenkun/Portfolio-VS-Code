## Projects

### Phishing Attack Domain Detection

- **Description**: This project aims to detect phishing domains using machine learning techniques. Different ML models were tested, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieved 99% accuracy with well-balanced precision and recall.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Feature Extraction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- **Key Features**:
  - Comparison of ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, MLP)
  - Feature engineering and data preprocessing
  - User-friendly web interface and microservice Rest API
- **Repository**: [Phishing-Domain-Detection](https://github.com/Virenkun/Phishing-Domain-Detection.git)

### Netflix Clone

- **Description**: A dynamic Netflix clone built with React and Firebase, featuring user authentication, subscription payments, and deployment on Google Firebase.
- **Technologies Used**: React, JavaScript, Firebase, Cloud Deployment, Authentication
- **Key Features**:
